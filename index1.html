			<h1>WHO INVENTED VOLLEYBALL</h1>
			<p>In the winter of 1895, in Holyoke, Massachusetts (United States), William G. Morgan, a YMCA
			physical education director, created a new game called Mintonette, a name derived from the game of
			badminton, as a pastime to be played (preferably) indoors and by any number of players. The game
			took some of its characteristics from other sports such as tennis and handball. Another indoor
			sport, basketball, was catching on in the area, having been invented just ten miles
			(sixteen kilometers) away in the city of Springfield, Massachusetts, only four years before.
			Mintonette was designed to be an indoor sport, less rough than basketball, for older members of the
			YMCA, while still requiring a bit of athletic effort.</p>
